# Handwritten Digits Recognition using Keras CNN  
### - Introduction:  
Constructing a Machine Learning model or a Deep Learning model or an Artificial Neural Network, that recognizes the digits from images, is considered to be the "Hello World!" of any field from the mentioned before. Therefore, in order to improve your skills and experinces, you should start the thousand miles journey from this.  

### - Dataset:  
Here, I used the MNIST HANDWRITTEN DIGITS dataset. The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It was created by "re-mixing" the samples from NIST's original datasets. The next figure shows a peak look into MNIST dataset:
